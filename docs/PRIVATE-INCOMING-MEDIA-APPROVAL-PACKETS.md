# #5229/#5230 approval packets

These packets separate read-only production inspection from every later write.
Filling a template is not approval. KEN must approve the exact packet, and any
changed head, resource ID, count, digest, or expiry invalidates that approval.

## Packet A — Cloudflare read-only preflight only

```text
Approval ID:
Expires at:
Mode: CF-READ-ONLY-PREFLIGHT-ONLY
Issues/PR: #5229 / #5230 / Draft PR #5244

Immutable code anchors:
- Accounting head:
- Harness head:
- Deployed Worker version/deployment ID:
- migration 071 SHA-256:
- migration 072 SHA-256:
- migration helper SHA-256:
- raw manifest SHA-256:
- canonical manifest SHA-256:

Exact targets:
- Cloudflare account label + ID: count=1
- Worker service/environment/origin: count=1
- D1 binding/name/ID: count=1
- R2 binding/bucket: count=1
- service credential ID and bound LINE account ID: count=1 each
- secure manifest locator: count=1
- candidates=N, excluded=E, total bytes=B

Allowed reads and exact maxima:
- identity/account GET: Q1
- Worker version/settings/bindings GET: Q2
- secret-binding metadata GET: Q3
- D1 SELECT/PRAGMA/migration-ledger queries: Q4
- R2 lifecycle list: 1
- R2 HEAD: N
- approved R2 content GET/hash checks: G
- private Worker HEAD: H
- private Worker GET: G
- anonymous/invalid/cross-account/wrong-method probes: X

Writes explicitly forbidden and expected count=0:
- deploy, D1 migration/INSERT/UPDATE, backup creation, R2 mutation,
  secret put/delete, credential creation/revocation, cache purge,
  feature enablement, process restart, LINE send, PR merge

Required sanitized readback:
- exact Worker version and public-block gate (must not equal true)
- binding names/types and presence; secret plaintext remains unavailable
- migration ledger for 071 and 072, table/index/column/FK/CHECK state
- R2 lifecycle rule count, canonical ruleset digest, incoming-prefix collision=0
- manifest digests/counts and exact D1 preimage/existing-ledger state
- R2 existence/MIME/bytes/metadata/content digest as approved
- credential ID/account/scope/active-window only; never its value or hash
- correct-account HEAD/GET=200; anonymous/invalid=401; cross-account=404;
  unrelated route=401; MIME/length/SHA agreement
- timestamps, provider request IDs, sanitized receipt locators

Stop on any drift, absent migration, lifecycle collision, placeholder/malformed
consumer credential, auth-matrix failure, manifest mismatch, or unexpected write.
Read-only rollback is none; retain/delete policy for local sensitive artifacts
must still be named.
```

Provider secret metadata proves only binding name/type/presence. It cannot prove
that a value is nonempty or not a placeholder. Prove those separately without
printing the value: consumer-side format/denylist checks plus a successful
correct-account runtime probe and negative auth matrix. If the credential code
or migration is not deployed, record `ABSENT -> STOP`; Packet A does not create it.

## Future write packets — never bundle

| Packet | Exact mutation | Required readback | Rollback boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| B0 credential issue/rotation | D1 hash row 1; accounting runtime secret 1; account 1 | new ID/account/scope; correct HEAD/GET; old/invalid/cross-account/unrelated denial | keep old row active until new runtime readback, then revoke under a new approval |
| B1 Worker deploy | Worker 1; exact artifact/head/version; gate remains off | deployment ID, routes, bindings, gate, negative auth matrix | exact previous Worker version; do not change D1/secrets |
| B2 migrations | D1 1; migration 071 then 072; exact checksums | migration ledger and table/index/FK/CHECK readback after each | additive tables remain; no automatic DROP |
| B3 manifest backfill | candidate N; ledger inserts N; exact JSON rewrites N; R2 writes/deletes 0 | changes N/N, preimage/replacement digests, R2 HEAD/GET, conflicts 0 | conditionally restore only exact replacement JSON; keep ledger/R2 |
| B4 gate deploy | Worker 1; gate false/unset -> true | deployed version, gate true, private route healthy, old origin URL 404 | reopening public evidence needs a new approval |
| B5 exact purge | URLs N in K batches; exact purge artifact digest | receipts for N; every old URL 404 | purge is irreversible; wildcard/prefix/purge-all forbidden |
| B6 credential revoke | old credential row 1 | old=401, new correct account=200, cross-account=404 | only possible during the approved overlap window |
| B7 accounting feature enable | exact company/account allowlist and mode before/after | target enabled, all non-targets off, kill switch/readback | return to off; LINE/Drive UAT remains separate |

Every B packet must state exact before/after, resource IDs, head/artifact hashes,
expected mutation counts, maintenance impact, stop conditions, readback, approval
expiry, rollback feasibility, and operations not authorized. PR merge and LINE
send always remain separate approvals.
